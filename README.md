NoteSkin hanubeki
=================

A simple flat -- but huge -- NoteSkin
A goal of this noteskin is to support every gametype (except lights).

This noteskin is targeted for Project OutFox, but it might work on StepMania 5.0.x, 5.1 beta (5_1-new) and Etterna but not StepMania 5.2 (5.1 alpha).

If you are looking for StepMania 5.2 (5.1 alpha) version, see [5.2-stale](https://github.com/hanubeki/noteskin-hanubeki/tree/5.2-stale) tag.
